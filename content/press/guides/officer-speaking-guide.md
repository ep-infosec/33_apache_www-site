## Speaking Guidelines for ASF Directors and Officers, and Apache project community leaders  {#officer-guides}
by Daniel Ruggeri and Sally Khudairi

Here are guidelines for anyone participating in external communications such as presentations, social media, blogs, interviews and conference calls. Because all communications can be nuanced and the world is not always black and white, we are always happy to help frame your message. Feel free to reach out any time to ASF Marketing & Publicity at press@apache.org for clarification or guidance, and consider attending Media & Analyst Training at an upcoming ApacheCon.

### Neutrality is a MUST ###
The ASF not only prides itself on being a place for all to come and participate; neutrality is also a legal requirement to maintain our status as a 501(c)(3). It is therefore imperative that we maintain a consistent approach to external communications. We explicitly disallow endorsements of public officials/politics/legislation and recommendations for products or services external entities offer. Statements in support or criticism of other entities (non-profits, public causes, consortia, etc.), official or otherwise, are very uncommon; you must consult with press@ prior to making such a statement.

### Wear your ASF hat only when needed ### 
The ASF is a volunteer-driven organization that recognizes individual contributions. It is therefore expected that individuals are giving their own opinion when delivering external messages. By default, an individual does not speak on behalf of The ASF (because after all, we are a community). However, there are times where you may need to speak on behalf of the foundation. When doing this, and in compliance with the rest of this document, you should sign/announce with your ASF hat (member, officer, director, etc.). It is not acceptable for personal opinions you express in external communications to have an ASF title in the signature or byline.

### Active disclaimers ### 
For messages by officers and directors that may venture into gray areas, you must provide a simple statement of "hat" near the beginning or in the summary of the external communication. Examples of gray areas are statements on topics The ASF has no official opinion on, opinions shared that are not consistent with The ASF's stance, and statements that are not perceived to be neutral.

Preferred boilerplate follows:
`This (post|presentation|response|email) represents my own personal opinion. It does not necessarily reflect the official stance of The Apache Software Foundation.`

### You are always on the record ### 
It is particularly important for officers and directors to remember that they are practically always on the record. Following the requirements in this document helps ensure consistent messaging and that you make any statements with the correct hat, but extra diligence is required for those bearing "official" titles. You may need to provide a more prominent disclaimer or even defer releasing a response until press@ can review the statement.

### Engage carefully and with the Code of Conduct in mind ### 
Regardless of hat your are wearing and the channel for the message, you must adhere to the <a href="/foundation/policies/conduct" target="_blank">ASF Code of Conduct</a> at all times.

### RTC ### 
Just as you cannot "un-release" a code release once you have publicly announced it, you cannot take back external communications and messages. Therefor, press@ **must** review any message that MAY be perceived as being an ASF-official statement before submission. This applies across all channels. External communications follow The ASF standard of _Review Then Commit_ (RTC) as opposed to _Commit Then Review_ (CTR).

### Consistency of message/do no harm ### 
Do **not** publish or send messages that are derogatory to, or inconsistent with the official stance of, The ASF as official statements of The ASF. This IS NOT intended to prohibit free speech or to prevent anyone from having an opinion that runs counter to The ASF. In fact, we encourage diversity of thought, and welcome _internal_ discussion of a wide range of ideas and positions. However, external communications that MAY be construed as being an ASF official statement must be consistent with the stance of The ASF. This is exactly why external communications are RTC: reviewers can help detect and correct inconsistencies during the review process.

### Context matters ### 
Be cognizant of the context surrounding an external communication. Viewers reading potentially-controversial messages in slide decks outside of or after the presentation, for example, may misunderstand them because they lack the context of of the message. Other examples include personal responses on social media/ASF lists to official ASF statements.

### Your words matter ### 
Even though you may state that you are providing your personal opinion, there is no guarantee that the media or others will not interpret or project that you are speaking in your official ASF role. It is not uncommon to have others attach your ASF title to your personal statement, no matter how many times you insist otherwise: a contentious statement an ASF official makes is much more quote- and click-worthy than a statement by someone who may be less recognizable otherwise. Furthermore, others may purposely used your personal remarks as an official ASF statement, so please be careful with your words.
